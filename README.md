# Indigo

Web-server in the middle of std and fasthttp.

Implemented:
- Stream-based request body processing
- Convinient response constructor
- Server-wide settings
- Convinient router with customizable error handlers, middlewares and handlers groups
- I don't know what else to write here

TODO:
- Add request context
- Fix bug with saving headers from previous request if were not used in a new one
- Add connection hijacking

As you can see, TODO list is bigger than implemented list. This means this project is a piece of shit (at least currently). So welcome if you wanna do it a bit better!
