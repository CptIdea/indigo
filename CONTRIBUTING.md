# Contributing
Contributing to the project is always welcome. To make a contribution, first open an issue that'll be used for discussion.

# That kinds of contribution are welcome
Any, if they don't break the following principles:
- Code at least not that smelling
- Code is formatted using `go fmt`
- All tests are passing
- If feature is error-prone, tests are bundled
- Performance must not degrade that much

# How to make a pull-request
After you've written some code, make sure all the commits have minimal-representative description and version is bumped respectively to semver.

Note: pull-requests MUST be opened to origin `dev` branch ONLY. Otherwise it'll be declined

# Code review
Each pull-request is code-reviewed. Maintainers may leave comments about code sections that should be fixed (e.g. poor code-style, bad practices, etc.)
